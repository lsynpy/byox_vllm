## Qwen Added Memories
- The project aims to build 'byoxvllm' from scratch, step by step. The working directory for this new project is 'byoxvllm'. The existing 'nanovllm' directory is for reference and should not be modified.
- Code files in byoxvllm directory have been cleaned of comments. Only add comments when explicitly instructed to do so.
- All Python code should be formatted using ruff before saving.
- Use pyenv local environment when running scripts.
- The nano-vllm code is located in the 'nanovllm' directory within the current repository (/Users/kx/code/byox_vllm/nanovllm).
- To validate changes to byoxvllm implementation, run 'cd /Users/kx/code/byox_vllm && python byoxvllm/run.py' which tests the model with a sample prompt and verifies that the output is generated correctly.
